# A Safe Place

A Safe Place is an organisational cross-platform mobile app with features to support those with executive dysfunction or who are neurodivergent. The app was created by a team of three over two weeks and is built using Dart, Flutter and Firebase.

With a focus on mental and physical health, A Safe Place helps users to keep on top of their medical appointments and to-do's, allowing them to save important information in an accessible, but safe, place.
