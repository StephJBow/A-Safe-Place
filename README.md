## Description

A Safe Place is an organisational cross-platform mobile app with features to support those with executive dysfunction or who are neurodivergent. The app was created by a team of three over two weeks and is built using Dart, Flutter and Firebase.

With a focus on mental and physical health, A Safe Place helps users to keep on top of their medical appointments and to-do's, allowing them to save important information in an accessible, but safe, place.

Using Firebase Firestore, I was able to set-up User Authentication by email. This adds a layer of security and allows users to create their unique account linked to their email address with a set password. It also displays an error when the wrong email or password is input.

Once signed it, the user can access their Home Page. A minimalist design, users have access to a Burger Menu on the top left and a Profile button on the top right, both with additional features.

<br> </br>
Users can then create new events, setting a specific date and time, creating and adding their own unique tags for events, uploading images or documents to attach to these events, and setting reminders.
<br> </br>
<img width="200" hspace="10" alt="14  Add tags" src="https://github.com/StephJBow/A-Safe-Place/assets/136998085/6986a9fd-0d31-45fa-b862-9b389bd08f1f">

<br> </br>
Tags add an extra level of organisation, and can help users quickly identify events by allocating specific colours and shapes to different types of event so that they can be more easily found within the 'All Events' page.
<br> </br>

<br> </br>
Images or documents saved on the device can also be uploaded and attached to each event, for example the user can take a photo of a letter or medical note associated with a specific appointment and attach it to this, to keep a record of any required and important paperwork.
<br> </br>
<img width="200" hspace="10" alt="20  Completed event" src="https://github.com/StephJBow/A-Safe-Place/assets/136998085/d6f39001-08b5-4ca6-a1cd-99967225d3c0">

<br> </br>
Once an event is saved, the user can then navigate to the 'All Events' page and find the new event displayed along with any other created events.

## Next steps

Plans for this mobile app were ambitious and, given my team only had two weeks to research and learn Flutter and Dart and put a working app together, there were some features that we had hoped to implement that we were not able to within the time given. However, we hope to continue working on this app and build additional functionality which will allow users to:
- Sign in using Google Authentication
- Set up recurring events
- Set up reminders for events
- Choose between light and dark modes
- Filter events by tags and search by event title
- Display upcoming events on the homepage
